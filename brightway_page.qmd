# Installation

1. [Install Python](python.qmd#installation) with Anaconda
2. Open an "Anaconda prompt" (on Windows, you find it in the Start menu).
3. Follow the [instructions for installing](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/content/installation/index.html) Brightway.

## For installing Brightway 2

If you want to check your model with the [Activity Browser](ab_page.qmd), you currently need to use Brightway 2 and not Brightway 2.5. Instructions for installing Brightway 2 are [available here](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/legacy/content/installation/installation.html#quickstart).

# Learn how to use it

In the Brightway documentation, [tutorials](https://learn.brightway.dev/) are provided and the notebooks available in the [live demo](https://docs.brightway.dev/projects/live) are also useful to get started.

Courses are regularly provided by the association [DÃ©part de Sentier](https://www.d-d-s.ch/) and the [Brightcon](https://2023.brightcon.link/) annual conference also offers classes and opportunities to learn via interactive presentations and a hackathon.

On this website, there is also a [code-along seminar](seminar_brightway.qmd) to be guided in doing a first LCA with brightway.
