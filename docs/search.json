    "text": "For this seminar, you should have the Activity Browser running on your computer and a project with ecoinvent open. For this, you need to:\n\nIf not already done, install Python and a Python environment manager,\nInstall or update the Activity Browser,\nCreate a project with ecoinvent 3.9.1 cutoff installed.\n\n\n\nIf you already have Python installed, skip this step. Otherwise, follow this link to download Anaconda. Follow the installation instructions of the installer.\n\n\nIf you think that you will use Python in the future, I recommend installing and using Mamba. It is much faster for “solving environments”, i.e., for installing or updating packages, and for creating new environments. For installing it, open an “Anaconda prompt” and use the command recommended here:\nconda install -c conda-forge mamba"
