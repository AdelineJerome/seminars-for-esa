    "text": "For this seminar, you should have the Activity Browser running on your computer and a project with ecoinvent open. For this, you need to:\n\nIf not already done, install Python and a Python environment manager,\nInstall or update the Activity Browser,\nCreate a project with ecoinvent 3.9.1 cutoff.\n\n\n\nIf you already have Python installed, skip this step. Otherwise, follow this link to download Anaconda. Follow the installation instructions of the installer.\n\n\nIf you think that you will use Python in the future, I recommend installing and using Mamba. It is much faster for “solving environments”, i.e., for installing or updating packages, and for creating new environments. For installing it, open an “Anaconda prompt” and use the command recommended here:\nconda install -c conda-forge mamba\n\n\n\n\nOpen an “Anaconda prompt” (on Windows, you find it on the Start menu) and follow the instructions for installing the Activity Browser, using the section The thorough way. Eventually, if you have mamba installed, use mamba to install the AB.\n\n\n\nFollow the instructions on this page to:\n\ncheck that the AB starts on your computer,\ncreate a new project:\n\non the tab “Project”, click on the button “+ New” and name the project (e.g., “ab_demo”),\nunder “Databases”, click on the button “Add default data (biosphere flows and impact categories)”. This takes a few minutes.\nimport the ecoinvent 3.9.1 cutoff database:\n\nDownload from the AB (easiest): click on the button “Import”, then “Import remote data (download)”, “ecoinvent (requires login)”, use the [[ESA login for ecoinvent]], and then select version 3.9.1 and the system model “cutoff”. The import takes a few minutes (longer than the step before).\nOtherwise, on ecoquery from ecoinvent download the 7z file “ecoinvent 3.9.3_cutoff_ecoSpold02.7z”. On the AB, click on the button “Import”, and then select “Import local data”, “Local 7z-archive of ecospold2 files” and select the downloaded file."
