Otherwise, follow this link to download Anaconda. Follow the installation instructions of the installer.\n\n\nIf you think that you will use Python in the future, I recommend installing and using Mamba. It is much faster for “solving environments”, i.e., for installing or updating packages, and for creating new environments. For installing it, open an “Anaconda prompt” and use the command recommended here:\nconda install -c conda-forge mamba\n\n\n\n\nOpen an “Anaconda prompt” (on Windows, you find it on the Start menu) and follow the instructions for installing the Activity Browser, using the section The thorough way.
