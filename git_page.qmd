# Material to get started

## Handbooks

- [Let's Git started](https://happygitwithr.com/) contains information to use Git for R on RStudio but most of the information are applicable for other applications as well.


## Courses

- The course *Reproducible Research in R* has a [section on Git](https://r-cubed-intro.rostools.org/sessions/version-control) which I recommend to understand why and how to do proper version control with Git.
