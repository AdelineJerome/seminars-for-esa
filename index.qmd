title: "Seminars for ESA"
---

This site has been developed to share knowledge on using open-source tools for environmental systems analysis (ESA). For an overview of tools developed for the field of industrial ecology, have a look at [this dashboard](https://github.com/IndEcol/Dashboard).

It also contains materials for organizing a seminar series on Brightway and the Activity Browser:

-   An [introduction](seminar_intro.qmd),
-   A first [code-along seminar](seminar_ab.qmd) for doing a first LCA on the Activity Browser,
-   Another [code-along seminar](seminar_brightway.qmd) for doing a first LCA on Brightway,
-   An [introduction to Git](seminar_git.qmd).

The content has been developed based on my personal experience as a life cycle assessment (LCA) practitioner. Feel free to [contact me](contact.qmd) if you have suggestions for contributions or changes!
