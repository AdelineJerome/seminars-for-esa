# Pre-seminar installation tasks

For this seminar, you should have the Activity Browser running on your computer and a project with ecoinvent open. For this, you need to:

1.  If not already done, [install](seminar_ab.qmd#installing-python-with-anaconda) Python and a Python environment manager,
2.  [Install](seminar_ab.qmd#installing-the-activity-browser) or update the Activity Browser,
3.  [Create a project](seminar_ab.qmd#create-an-lca-project-on-the-ab) with ecoinvent 3.9.1 cutoff.

## Installing Python with Anaconda

If you already have Python installed, skip this step. Otherwise, [follow this link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to download Anaconda. Follow the installation instructions of the installer.

## Installing the Activity Browser

Open an "Anaconda prompt" (on Windows, you find it on the Start menu) and follow the [instructions for installing](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser#installation) the Activity Browser, using the section *The thorough way*.

## Create an LCA project on the AB

Follow the [instructions on this page](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser#getting-started) to:

-   check that the AB starts on your computer,
-   create a new project:
    -   on the tab "Project", click on the button "+ New" and name the project (e.g., "ab_demo"),
    -   under "Databases", click on the button "Add default data (biosphere flows and impact categories)". This takes a few minutes.
    -   import the ecoinvent 3.9.1 cutoff database:
        -   Download from the AB (easiest): click on the button "Import", then "Import remote data (download)", "ecoinvent (requires login)", use the \[\[ESA login for ecoinvent\]\], and then select version 3.9.1 and the system model "cutoff". The import takes a few minutes (longer than the step before).
        -   Otherwise, on [ecoquery from ecoinvent](https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.9.1/cutoff/files) download the 7z file "ecoinvent 3.9.3_cutoff_ecoSpold02.7z". On the AB, click on the button "Import", and then select "Import local data", "Local 7z-archive of ecospold2 files" and select the downloaded file.
