# Pre-seminar installation tasks

For this seminar, you should have the Activity Browser running on your computer and a project with ecoinvent open. For this, you need to:

1.  If not already done, [install](seminar_ab.qmd#installing-python-with-anaconda) Python and a Python environment manager,
2.  [Install](seminar_ab.qmd#installing-the-activity-browser) or update the Activity Browser,
3.  [Create a project](seminar_ab.qmd#create-an-lca-project-on-the-ab) with ecoinvent 3.9.1 cutoff.

## Installing Python with Anaconda

If you already have Python installed, skip this step. Otherwise, [follow this link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) to download Anaconda. Follow the installation instructions of the installer.

## Installing the Activity Browser

Open an "Anaconda prompt" (on Windows, you find it on the Start menu) and follow the [instructions for installing](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser#installation) the Activity Browser, using the section *The thorough way*.

## Create an LCA project on the AB

Follow the [instructions on this page](https://github.com/LCA-ActivityBrowser/activity-browser#getting-started) to:

-   check that the AB starts on your computer,
-   create a new project:
    -   on the tab "Project", click on the button "+ New" and name the project (e.g., "ab_demo"),
    -   under "Databases", click on the button "Add default data (biosphere flows and impact categories)". This takes a few minutes.
    -   import the ecoinvent 3.9.1 cutoff database:
        -   Download from the AB (easiest): click on the button "Import", then "Import remote data (download)", "ecoinvent (requires login)", use the ESA login for ecoinvent, and then select version 3.9.1 and the system model "cutoff". The import takes a few minutes (longer than the step before).
        -   Otherwise, on [ecoquery from ecoinvent](https://ecoquery.ecoinvent.org/3.9.1/cutoff/files) download the 7z file "ecoinvent 3.9.3_cutoff_ecoSpold02.7z". On the AB, click on the button "Import", and then select "Import local data", "Local 7z-archive of ecospold2 files" and select the downloaded file.

## First LCA with the AB

As an example, we will reproduce a simplified version of the results in [Jerome et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resconrec.2023.107038). All the data are from the article and the supplementary information. The aim is the compare the LCA results for motors with different energy efficiency, and with and without their use extension with repair.

### LCA model construction

**Create a new database** by clicking on the button "+ New" besides "Databases". Name your database, e.g., `motor_case`.

The first activity that we will use is electricity production. Go to your ecoinvent database, search for the *market for electricity, high voltage* for Sweden (SE). Right click on the activity and choose "Duplicate activity to new location" to duplicate the activity to your new database.

**Create parameters** in the tab "Parameters". Create the following project parameters:

| Name                    | Value | Description                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| ```steel_unalloyed```   | 26600 | Quantity (kg) of unalloyed steel in the motor   |
| ```steel_low_alloyed``` | 4100  | Quantity (kg) of low alloyed steel in the motor |
| ```copper```            | 3600  | Quantity (kg) of copper in the motor            |
| ```insulation```        | 400   | Quantity (kg) of insulation in the motor        |
| ```output_power```      | 16000 | Output power (kW) of the motor                  |
| ```op_hours```          | 8400  | Duration (hours) of operating time per year     |
| ```lifetime```          | 20    | Lifetime (years) of the motor                   |
| ```efficiency```                        |  0.973     |     Efficiency of the motor                                            |


To **create new activities**, right click on the name of your new database and select "+ Add new activity". Create the following activities:

1. *motor production* with:
    - ```steel_unalloyed``` of *market for steel, unalloyed - GLO*
    - ```steel_low_alloyed``` of *market for steel, low-alloyed - GLO*
