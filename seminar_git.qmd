# Pre-seminar installation tasks

If you want to try to save your work with Git during the seminar:

1.  [Install Git](seminar_git.qmd#installing-git) on your computer,
2.  [Create a GitHub account](seminar_git.qmd#create-a-github-account) if you want to have your work saved on the cloud.

## Installing Git

For Windows, download and install [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

For other distributions, download and install [Git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Create a GitHub account

When you want to backup your work on the cloud with Git, your code is sent to a GitHub repository. For this, you need to create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Remember the email to you use to create your account!
